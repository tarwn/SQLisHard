SQLisHard
=========

Learning SQL can be difficult and we tend to learn best by doing. This started as a short project 
to build a site that would allow you to interactively learn SQL, but real life has caused it to 
take far longer than I originally planned.

The initial release is focused entirely on a minimal product with a string foundation. A lot of 
the change deployment, test infrastructure, and so on has been built to let me quickly add small
features or additions as I have time. Additional exercises, new exercise sets, more extensive
query functionality, the ability to save progress and login, these are all features in the idea 
list that have not been added yet.

Check out the About section of http://sqlishard.com for more up to date general information.
